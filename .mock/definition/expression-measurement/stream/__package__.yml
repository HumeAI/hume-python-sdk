          Length in milliseconds of streaming sliding window.


          Extending the length of this window will prepend media context from
          past payloads into the current payload.


          For example, if on the first payload you send 500ms of data and on the
          second payload you send an additional 500ms of data, a window of at
          least 1000ms will allow the model to process all 1000ms of stream
          data.


          A window of 600ms would append the full 500ms of the second payload to
          the last 100ms of the first payload.

      Compared to returning one estimate of sentiment, this enables a more
      nuanced analysis of a text's meaning. For example, a text with very
      neutral sentiment would have an average rating of 5. But also a text that
      could be interpreted as having very positive sentiment or very negative
      sentiment would also have an average rating of 5. The average sentiment is
      less informative than the distribution over sentiment, so this API returns
      a value for each sentiment level.
