  Granularity:

    docs: >-
      The granularity at which to generate predictions. The `granularity` field
      is ignored if transcription is not enabled or if the `window` field has
      been set.


      - `word`: At the word level, our model provides a separate output for each
      word, offering the most granular insight into emotional expression during
      speech. 


      - `sentence`: At the sentence level of granularity, we annotate the
      emotional tone of each spoken sentence with our Prosody and Emotional
      Language models. 


      - `utterance`: Utterance-level granularity is between word- and
      sentence-level. It takes into account natural pauses or breaks in speech,
      providing more rapidly updated measures of emotional expression within a
      flowing conversation. For text inputs, utterance-level granularity will
      produce results identical to sentence-level granularity. 


      - `conversational_turn`: Conversational turn-level granularity provides a
      distinct output for each change in speaker. It captures the full sequence
      of words and sentences spoken uninterrupted by each person. This approach
      provides a higher-level view of the emotional dynamics in a
      multi-participant dialogue. For text inputs, specifying conversational
      turn-level granularity for our Emotional Language model will produce
      results for the entire passage.

          Sentiment predictions returned as a distribution. This model predicts
          the probability that a given text could be interpreted as having each
          sentiment level from `1` (negative) to `9` (positive).


          Compared to returning one estimate of sentiment, this enables a more
          nuanced analysis of a text's meaning. For example, a text with very
          neutral sentiment would have an average rating of `5`. But also a text
          that could be interpreted as having very positive sentiment or very
          negative sentiment would also have an average rating of `5`. The
          average sentiment is less informative than the distribution over
          sentiment, so this API returns a value for each sentiment level.

  Window:

      Setting the `window` field allows for a 'sliding window' approach, where a
      fixed-size window moves across the audio or video file in defined steps.
      This enables continuous analysis of prosody within subsets of the file,
      providing dynamic and localized insights into emotional expression.

  Sentiment:
    docs: >-
      Sentiment predictions returned as a distribution. This model predicts the
      probability that a given text could be interpreted as having each
      sentiment level from 1 (negative) to 9 (positive).


      Compared to returning one estimate of sentiment, this enables a more
      nuanced analysis of a text's meaning. For example, a text with very
      neutral sentiment would have an average rating of 5. But also a text that
      could be interpreted as having very positive sentiment or very negative
      sentiment would also have an average rating of 5. The average sentiment is
      less informative than the distribution over sentiment, so this API returns
      a value for each sentiment level.
