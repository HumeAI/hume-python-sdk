      Webhook events are JSON payloads to your server during an EVI chat. You
      can subscribe to specific events, and set which URLs should be notified in
      the
      [Config](/reference/empathic-voice-interface-evi/configs/create-config#request.body.webhooks)
      resource. Read the [Webhook
      Guide](/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/webhooks) for more information.
