          Currently, the only built-in tool Hume provides is **Web Search**.

          incoming messages.


          It is recommended to pass a `custom_session_id` if you are using a

          used for the session.


          You can use the Prompt to define a specific goal or role for EVI,
          specifying how it should act or what it should focus on during the
          conversation. For example, EVI can be instructed to act as a customer
          support representative, a fitness coach, or a travel advisor, each
          with its own set of behaviors and response styles.


          For help writing a system prompt, see our [Prompting
          Guide](/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/guides/prompting).
      tools:
        type: optional<list<Tool>>
        docs: >-
          List of user-defined tools to enable for the session.


          Tools are resources used by EVI to perform various tasks, such as
          searching the web or calling external APIs. Built-in tools, like web
          search, are natively integrated, while user-defined tools are created
          and invoked by the user. To learn more, see our [Tool Use
          Guide](/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/features/tool-use).
      type:
        type: literal<"session_settings">
        docs: >-
          The type of message sent through the socket; must be
          `session_settings` for our server to correctly identify and process it
          as a Session Settings message.


          Session settings are temporary and apply only to the current Chat
          session. These settings can be adjusted dynamically based on the
          requirements of each session to ensure optimal performance and user
          experience.


          For more information, please refer to the [Session Settings
          guide](/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/configuration/session-settings).
      variables:
        type: optional<map<string, SessionSettingsVariablesValue>>
        docs: >-
          This field allows you to assign values to dynamic variables referenced
          in your system prompt.


          Each key represents the variable name, and the corresponding value is
          the specific content you wish to assign to that variable within the
          session. While the values for variables can be strings, numbers, or
          booleans, the value will ultimately be converted to a string when
          injected into your system prompt.


          Using this field, you can personalize responses based on
          session-specific details. For more guidance, see our [guide on using
          dynamic
          variables](/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/features/dynamic-variables).

      Event messages are sent by the server when specific events occur during a
      chat session. These messages are used to configure behaviors for EVI, such
      as controlling how EVI starts a new conversation.
    properties:

        docs: >-
          Specifies the message EVI provides when the chat is about to be
          disconnected due to a user inactivity timeout, such as a message
          mentioning a lack of user input for a period of time.


          Enabling an inactivity message allows developers to use this message
          event for "checking in" with the user if they are not responding to
          see if they are still active.


          If the user does not respond in the number of seconds specified in the
          `inactivity_timeout` field, then EVI will say the message and the user
          has 15 seconds to respond. If they respond in time, the conversation
          will continue; if not, the conversation will end.


          However, if the inactivity message is not enabled, then reaching the
