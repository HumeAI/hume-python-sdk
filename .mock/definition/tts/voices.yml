          page_number:
            type: optional<integer>
            docs: >-
              Specifies the page number to retrieve, enabling pagination.


              This parameter uses zero-based indexing. For example, setting
              `page_number` to 0 retrieves the first page of results (items 0-9
              if `page_size` is 10), setting `page_number` to 1 retrieves the
              second page (items 10-19), and so on. Defaults to 0, which
              retrieves the first page.
          page_size:
            type: optional<integer>
            docs: >-
              Specifies the maximum number of results to include per page,
              enabling pagination. The value must be between 1 and 100,
              inclusive.


              For example, if `page_size` is set to 10, each page will include
              up to 10 items. Defaults to 10.
