    access_token:
      type: optional<string>
      default: ''
      docs: >-
        Access token used for authenticating the client. If not provided, an
        `api_key` must be provided to authenticate.


        The access token is generated using both an API key and a Secret key,
        which provides an additional layer of security compared to using just an
        API key.


        For more details, refer to the [Authentication Strategies
        Guide](/docs/introduction/api-key#authentication-strategies).
    context_generation_id:
      type: optional<string>
      docs: >-
        The ID of a prior TTS generation to use as context for generating
        consistent speech style and prosody across multiple requests. Including
        context may increase audio generation times.
    format_type: root.AudioFormatType
    include_timestamp_types:
      type: optional<root.TimestampType>
      allow-multiple: true
      docs: The set of timestamp types to include in the response.
    instant_mode:
      type: optional<boolean>
      default: true
      docs: >-
        Enables ultra-low latency streaming, significantly reducing the time
        until the first audio chunk is received. Recommended for real-time
        applications requiring immediate audio playback. For further details,
        see our documentation on [instant
        mode](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview#ultra-low-latency-streaming-instant-mode).
    no_binary:
      type: optional<boolean>
      default: false
      docs: If enabled, no binary websocket messages will be sent to the client.
    strip_headers:
      type: optional<boolean>
      default: false
      docs: >-
        If enabled, the audio for all the chunks of a generation, once
        concatenated together, will constitute a single audio file. Otherwise,
        if disabled, each chunk's audio will be its own audio file, each with
        its own headers (if applicable).
    version:
      type: root.OctaveVersion
      docs: >-
        Selects the Octave model version used to synthesize speech for this
        request. If you omit this field, Hume automatically routes the request
        to the most appropriate model. Setting a specific version ensures stable
        and repeatable behavior across requests.


        Use `2` to opt into the latest Octave capabilities. When you specify
        version `2`, you must also provide a `voice`. Requests that set
        `version: 2` without a voice will be rejected.


        For a comparison of Octave versions, see the [Octave
        versions](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview#octave-versions) section in
        the TTS overview.
    api_key:
      type: optional<string>
      default: ''
      docs: >-
        API key used for authenticating the client. If not provided, an
        `access_token` must be provided to authenticate.
