      strip_headers:
        type: optional<boolean>
        docs: >-
          If enabled, the audio for all the chunks of a generation, once
          concatenated together, will constitute a single audio file. Otherwise,
          if disabled, each chunk's audio will be its own audio file, each with
          its own headers (if applicable).
        default: false
      utterances:
        docs: >-
          A list of **Utterances** to be converted to speech output.


          An **Utterance** is a unit of input for
          [Octave](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview), and includes input
          `text`, an optional `description` to serve as the prompt for how the
          speech should be delivered, an optional `voice` specification, and
          additional controls to guide delivery for `speed` and
          `trailing_silence`.
        type: list<PostedUtterance>
      version:
        type: optional<OctaveVersion>
        docs: >-
          Selects the Octave model version used to synthesize speech for this
          request. If you omit this field, Hume automatically routes the request
          to the most appropriate model. Setting a specific version ensures
          stable and repeatable behavior across requests.


          Use `2` to opt into the latest Octave capabilities. When you specify
          version `2`, you must also provide a `voice`. Requests that set
          `version: 2` without a voice will be rejected.


          For a comparison of Octave versions, see the [Octave
          versions](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview#octave-versions) section
          in the TTS overview.
      instant_mode:
        type: optional<boolean>
        docs: >-
          Enables ultra-low latency streaming, significantly reducing the time
          until the first audio chunk is received. Recommended for real-time
          applications requiring immediate audio playback. For further details,
          see our documentation on [instant
          mode](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview#ultra-low-latency-streaming-instant-mode). 

          - A
          [voice](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-json-streaming#request.body.utterances.voice)
          must be specified when instant mode is enabled. Dynamic voice
          generation is not supported with this mode.

          - Instant mode is only supported for streaming endpoints (e.g.,
          [/v0/tts/stream/json](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-json-streaming),
          [/v0/tts/stream/file](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-file-streaming)).

          - Ensure only a single generation is requested
          ([num_generations](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-json-streaming#request.body.num_generations)
          must be `1` or omitted).

          **This field behaves differently depending on whether a voice is
          specified**:

          - **Voice specified**: the description will serve as acting directions
          for delivery. Keep directions concise—100 characters or fewer—for best
          results. See our guide on [acting
          instructions](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/acting-instructions).

          - **Voice not specified**: the description will serve as a voice
          prompt for generating a voice. See our [prompting
          guide](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/prompting) for design tips.
