          - When **disabled** (`false`), the response maintains a strict
          one-to-one mapping between input utterances and output snippets. 


          This setting affects how the `snippets` array is structured in the
          response, which may be important for applications that need to track
          the relationship between input text and generated audio segments. When
          setting to `false`, avoid including utterances with long `text`, as

          see our documentation on [instant
          mode](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview#ultra-low-latency-streaming-instant-mode). 

          - Dynamic voice generation is not supported with this mode; a

          [voice](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-json-streaming#request.body.utterances.voice)
          must be specified in your request.

          - This mode is only supported for streaming endpoints (e.g.,

          [/v0/tts/stream/file](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-file-streaming)).

          - Ensure only a single generation is requested
          ([num_generations](/reference/text-to-speech-tts/synthesize-json-streaming#request.body.num_generations)
          must be `1` or omitted).

          - With `instant_mode` enabled, **requests incur a 10% higher cost**
          due to increased compute and resource requirements.
