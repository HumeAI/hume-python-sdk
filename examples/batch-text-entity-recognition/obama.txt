President Obama called Wednesday on Congress to extend a tax break for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing that the policy provides more generous assistance. The American Opportunity Tax Credit program, which will cost $58 billion over a decade, is due to expire at the end of this year. In a statement to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, Obama said the tax breaks help make a college education more affordable for Americans. "I am calling on Congress to make this tax credit permanent," Obama said, using the occasion to campaign for Democratic policies on education in the upcoming congressional elections on November 2. After touting his administration's steps to expand student loans and reform public school education in the country, Obama said Republicans want to cut government spending that could include a 20 percent reduction in education funding.
