    **This field behaves differently depending on whether a voice is specified**:
    - **Voice specified**: the description will serve as acting directions for delivery. Keep directions concise—100 characters or fewer—for best results. See our guide on [acting instructions](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/acting-instructions).
    - **Voice not specified**: the description will serve as a voice prompt for generating a voice. See our [prompting guide](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/prompting) for design tips.
