    Prompts, as well as Configs and Tools, are versioned. This versioning system supports iterative development, allowing you to progressively refine prompts and revert to previous versions if needed.

    Instructions used to shape EVIâ€™s behavior, responses, and style.
    
    You can use the Prompt to define a specific goal or role for EVI, specifying how it should act or what it should focus on during the conversation. For example, EVI can be instructed to act as a customer support representative, a fitness coach, or a travel advisor, each with its own set of behaviors and response styles.
